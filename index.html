            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a passionate Engineer with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My very first experience with code was at the time when I started my own blog. My struggle to customize the blog pages introduced me to HTML & CSS. 
                Sooner, the excitment of having the power to structure pages on my own sounded amazing and that’s when I decided to purse Web development.
    
                Recently, I learnt Full Stack Development. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Java, C++ and Data Structures. Rational thought process and goal-oriented planning are my strengths.
                
                I am currently on the look out for a challenging role to build products that make a difference.</p>
